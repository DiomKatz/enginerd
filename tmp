                            <p>Diomidis Katzourakis currently serves as the Platform Systems Lead at Waabi.ai, a role in which he is responsible for the Systems Engineering of the Autonomous Platform. This encompasses the entire autonomy stack, excluding behavior and decision-making, a position he has held since October 2024.
                                Prior to joining Waabi.ai, Diomidis was an Assistant Professor of Industrial Innovation on Autonomous Systems and Head of the Industrial Innovation on Autonomous (I2A) Systems group at the School of Production Engineering & Management, Technical University of Crete (TUC) in Chania, Greece, from October 2023 to October 2024.

                                From July 2019 to October 2023, he was the Systems Engineering Manager for Motion Control and Vehicle Dynamics at Waymo (formerly the Google car project). He was the technical lead and manager of the motion control and vehicle dynamics Systems Engineering team for both Waymo's autonomous ride-hailing and trucking businesses. His responsibilities included managing three functional teams focused on: Defining system-level requirements for the motion control system and its interface with the planner.
                                Developing motion control and vehicle dynamics specifications/requirements for Waymo vehicle platforms (passenger cars and trucks), including actuator development with external partners. Advancing vehicle system dynamics simulation development (software, model, validation, and verification) and applying it to specify requirements.

                                Earlier in his career, from May 2015 to July 2019, Diomidis worked at Apple Inc. in California, USA, within the Special Projects Group. There, as a Product Design and Controls Engineer, he designed and led the development of various dynamic control systems for autonomous technologies (details are confidential). Before Apple, from October 2012 to April 2015, he was with Volvo Car Corporation in Gothenburg, Sweden, in CAE Active Safety, where he was responsible for developing and releasing chassis control systems using CAE methods, facilitating the production of mathematically optimized cars directly from design.
                                Diomidis holds a PhD in "Driver Steering Support Interface Near the Vehicleâ€™s Handling Limits" from the Technical University of Delft, completed between 2008 and 2012. He earned an M.Sc. in electronics and embedded systems in 2008 (TUC) and a diploma of engineering in "Autonomous Vehicle Guidance" between 2001 and 2006 at the University of Patras in Greece. Diomidis Katzourakis was born in Chania, Crete, Greece</p>
